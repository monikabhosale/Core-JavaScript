is known as a method . In addition to objects that are predefined in the beowser, you can define your own objects.
var fees={monika:100
sumit:40,
ankya:88,
harsha:89
total:function(){return(100+40+88+89);}
};

  // declaration and initialization of object.
  .using object literal
  
  syntax: var object_name={};
