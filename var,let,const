/* var - the  scope of a variable declared with var is its current execution context, which is either the enclosing function or, for variables declared outside  any function 
,global
 Let:-let allows you to declare variables that are limited  in scope to the block to the block,statment,or expression on which it is used.
 const:- this declaration creates a constants whose scope can be either global constant  do not become properties of or local to the block in which it is declared . global constants do not constant do not 
          become  properties of the window object, unlike var variables. an initializer for a constant is required; that is ,
          you must specify its value in the same statment in which it's  value in the same  statement in which it's declared which can't be  changed later.
